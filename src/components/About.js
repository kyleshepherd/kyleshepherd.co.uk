            Iâ€™m Kyle, a Front End Engineer currently based in Falmouth, UK. I
            studied Games Development at Falmouth University, specialising in
            Programming and graduating in 2019. During my time at university, I
            worked on 5 game projects in interdisciplinary teams, these projects
            varied from first person puzzle games to couch competitive
            multiplayer games to third person shooters. <br />
            <br />
            During my final year of university, I moved into web development,
            using online courses and tutorials to learn the basics before
            starting an internship.
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm currently at London-based digital agency SOON_, working on
            projects using Svelte and React as our main frontend frameworks.

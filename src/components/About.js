            Iâ€™m Kyle, a full stack web developer currently based in Falmouth, UK. I studied Games Development:
            Programming at Falmouth University, graduating in 2019. During my time at university, I worked on 5 game
            projects in interdisciplinary teams, these projects varied from first person puzzle games to couch
            competitive multiplayer games to third person shooters. <br/><br/>
            During my final year of university, I secured a web development internship with a local agency and proceeded
            to work there full time after graduating, working on large scale Wordpress websites for a variety of
            clients. I have recently joined Builtbycactus, a Cornish development agency creating a multitude of
            applications using Laravel, React, Ionic and Wordpress.

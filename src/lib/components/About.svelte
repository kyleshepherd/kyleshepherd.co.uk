		>, a London-based digital agency focused on eCommerce. Here, I've led the development of several
		large-scale web applications using SvelteKit and React, and helped build and maintain a suite of
		in-house services written in Go—including our custom CMS and image processing tools. My role
		spans the full stack, from frontend UI development to backend APIs and infrastructure, with
		deployments to Google Cloud Platform using tools like Helm, Terraform, and Kubernetes.<br /><br
		/>
		Beyond development, I'm heavily involved in shaping features and functionality through planning and
		technical design. I also support team growth through code reviews and mentoring junior developers
		to ensure consistent, high-quality output.<br /><br />
		In my spare time, I work on personal and freelance projects—including an NFT-based iOS game and a
		Discord bot that's installed on over 1,000 servers.
